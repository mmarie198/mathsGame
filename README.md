10 Second Math Game built with HTML/CSS and JS.
This is a game where the user needs to input the correct answer to a basic arithmetic equation. There is a time limit of 10 seconds for which the user can input the correct answer and progress to the next question. If the user runs out of time, the game ends. If the user makes a correct guess, an additional 1 second is added to the available time.
